#Search.js is searching for all files that contains a specified string under the current directory
#
#For example, when the user executes the following command:
#C:\MyFolder> node search.js txt Ori
#
#The application searches for all files with the extension txt under C:\MyFolder (including subdirectories) that contain the string Ori.
#Once the search completes, the application displays the list of all matching files (full path)
#
